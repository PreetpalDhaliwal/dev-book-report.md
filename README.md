## Why does this video interest me?
- Kevin Powell is known to be one of the most helpful coding experts out there. With over 600,000 subscribers he succeeds in helping fellow coders. In the video I have provided above, Kevin gives an amazing description of HTML for beginners. As a new person in the coding industry (Junior Web Developer), this video helped me plenty. He goes through what divs, classes, I'Ds, etc, are. The video basically covered everything so a person who even knows nothing about HTML, can get an understanding of what it will be like.

## Publish date, still relevant?
- Although that the video is only 9 months old, it is still relevant in today's world. Things change over time, and even 5-year-old coding videos can still provide useful information.

## Is the author credible?
- As I previously stated, Kevin Powell is a brilliant man who is incredibly helpful. His voice, in my opinion, is very calming, with no rush or stress. The video has over 70,000 views and the comment section is filled with positive feedback. In the end, everyone has a preference, and Kevin Powell has demonstrated HTML in an amazing way that I greatly appreciate.
